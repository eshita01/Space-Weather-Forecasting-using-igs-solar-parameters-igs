# Space-Weather-Forecasting-using-IGS Datasets-solar-parameters(both spatial and temporal variations)-igs
Task was to develop an ionospheric model based on different geomagnetic locations on earth. The work done as a part of this internship was to Correlate Total Electron Count (TEC) from GNSS data with solar indices and parameters like flare speed, sunspot number, DST, solar wind speed, etc for an X class flare for some days. Moreover, the results from the correlations were used in order to develop a regional and later on a global ionospheric model and further classifying the solar flares in their respective types using modern tools like Machine Learning. The use of libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Pyomni , Matplotlib etc and software like GPS-TEC Analysis were done in order to process and analyse the complex data sets.
